            Our Risk Guarantee I believe a partnership should be built on trust
            and shared success. To that end, I want to assume the risk: · You
            won't pay the final project balance until you have approved and
            launched your new website. · You are protected by our 15-Day
            Satisfaction Guarantee. If, after launch, the site does not meet the
            specifications we agreed upon, we will work tirelessly to make it
            right. If we cannot, you will receive a full refund. My goal is not
            just to complete a project, but to become a long-term technology
            partner for your business.
